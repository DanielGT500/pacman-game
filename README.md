# pacman-game
A game I've been on as a project as part of my learning with <a href="www.scrimba.com">Scrimba</a> to become a web developer.

The game is controllable with the arrow keys on the keyboard. 
My customisations of the base game include: 
<ul>
    <li>Custom font: "CrackMan"</li>
    <li>Pacman logo</li>
    <li>Animated transparent gif images for pacman, the ghosts and their scared state</li>
    <li>Custom image for pac-dots and power pellets</li>
    <li>Custom "Game Over" text displayed if Pacman is caught by a ghost</li>
    <li>Once all of the pac-dots and power pellets are eaten on screen, they'll replenish</li>
    <li>Custom "You win!" text displayed if score of 10,000 reached, with option to restart</li>
</ul>
