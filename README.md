# pacman-game
A game I've been on as a project as part of my learning with <a href="www.scrimba.com">Scrimba</a> to become a web developer.

The game is controllable with the arrow keys on the keyboard. 
My customisations of the base game include: 
    - Custom font: "CrackMan"
    - Pacman logo
    - Animated transparent gif images for pacman, the ghosts and their scared state
    - Custom image for pac-dots and power pellets
    - Custom "Game Over" text displayed if Pacman is caught by a ghost
    - Once all of the pac-dots and power pellets are eaten on screen, they'll replenish
    - Custom "You win!" text displayed if score of 10,000 reached, with option to restart
